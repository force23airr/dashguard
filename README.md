# DashGuard

A community-driven dash cam platform where drivers can upload footage, report incidents, and alert others about dangerous driving, crime, and security concerns in real-time.

## Features

- **User Authentication** - Register and login with JWT-based authentication
- **Incident Reporting** - Upload dash cam videos/images and report incidents with location, type, and severity
- **Real-time Alerts** - Broadcast alerts to the community via WebSockets
- **Incident Browsing** - Filter and search incidents by type, severity, and status
- **User Profiles** - View submission history and statistics

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18
- Vite
- React Router
- Socket.io Client
- Axios

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- Socket.io
- Multer (file uploads)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/force23airr/dashguard.git
   cd dashguard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:

   Edit `server/.env` with your settings:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dashguard
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
   ```

4. Start MongoDB (if running locally)

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts both the backend (port 5000) and frontend (port 5173).
